					<h1>Worship Night - 2019</h1>
					<h2></h2>
					<p>Christmas is "the Season of Joy"</p>
          <p>but to many people it's become synonymous with the word "stress"</p>
          <p>this event is an opportunity to relax, and find some time to honour Jesus in the season he created</p>
          <p>we'd love to see you there,</p>
          <p>Isaac & Jacob Winter</p>
