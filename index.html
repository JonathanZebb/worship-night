			<h1>Worship Night - 2019</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Christmas is "the Season of Joy"</p>
			<p>but to many people it's become synonymous with the word "stress"</p>
			<p>this event is an opportunity to relax, and to honour Jesus in the season he created</p>
			<p>we'd love to see you there,</p>
			<p>Isaac & Jacob Winter</p>
